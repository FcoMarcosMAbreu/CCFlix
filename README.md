Creative Commons video collection

Repo to demonstrate my skills with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript among other things like embedded videos, route based on files, custom fonts and deploy to the world! There is no need to clone this repo to your machine. You can check the code files above and the result at Cloudflare Pages: [https://ccflix.pages.dev/](https://ccflix.pages.dev/).

My inspiration was expose movies under Creative Common license and public domain. You can watch the videos for free! Say me what improvements you want to see.
